Creation of RESTful API with connection to SQL database with Azure and Union with Blazor Server.
Detailed description:

## RESTful API:

Definition: A RESTful API is an interface that allows web applications to communicate with each other by using standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to access resources (data) on a server.

## Creation:

Tools: You can use ASP.NET Core with Visual Studio or tools such as Swagger to create the API.

## Connection to SQL database with Azure:

Azure SQL Database: Fully managed SQL database in the cloud.

## Configuration:

- Create a database in Azure Portal.

- Obtain the database connection string.

- Implement database access in the API using ADO.NET or Entity Framework.

## Link with Blazor Server:

Blazor Server is a web framework that allows you to create interactive web applications using C#.

## Integration:

- Consuming the RESTful API from the client side in Blazor Server.

- Display and modify data in the user interface of the Blazor application.

## Advantages:

- Shared code between front-end and back-end.

- Increased performance and security.

- Ease of development for complex web applications.
